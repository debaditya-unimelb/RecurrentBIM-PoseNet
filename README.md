# RecurrentBIM-PoseNet
This is an implementation of Recurrent BIM-PoseNet for camera pose regression related to our upcoming work. More details will be available soon.  

The training and the test data can be found in [this](https://melbourne.figshare.com/articles/UnimelbCorridorSynthetic_zip/10930457) repository. 

Compatibility: Tensorflow 1.9.0, Cudatoolkit=9.0, Keras 1.2.2, Python 2.7

## Initilal and fine-tuned weight files
The initial weight file (GoogleNet V1 trained on the Places dataset) and the fine-tuned model weights can be found [here](https://melbourne.figshare.com/articles/GoogleNet_weights_trained_on_the_Places_dataset_for_Keras_/10959350). The following are the details of the fine-tuned weight files:

- SynCar - Weights of model fine-tuned on Synthetic Cartoonish images.
- SynPhoReal - Weights of model fine-tuned on Synthetic photo-realistic images.
- SynPhoRealTex - Weights of model fine-tuned on Synthetic photo-realistic textured images.
- GradmagSynCar - Weights of model fine-tuned on synthetic gradmag of SynCar images.
- EdgeRender - Weights of model fine-tuned on Synthetic edge render images.

Other details in the name of the weight files describes the parameters, such as window length, learning rate, batch, ...., etc.
